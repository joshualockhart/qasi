# qasi
A web app for when you need to Quickly Annotate Some Images.

## Getting started
Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add to path:

```
PATH=$PATH:/place/where/you/downloaded/qasi
```

Fire up the qasi server: 
```
qasi --dir /my/image/directory
```

Navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000 and commence labelling!

## Todo/issues:
Things will not go well for Qasi if more than one instance is run at a time.

Qasi is very very rudimentary, and has no tests.

Qasi is not much to look at, perhaps some styling of the web pages could be helpful.
